# Insertion sort 

## Explanation 
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is efficient for small datasets and works by repeatedly taking an element from the unsorted part and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part of the array. In this blog article,I will explore the Insertion Sort algorithm using the provided pseudocode and apply it to sample arrays. After that,  implement the algorithm in Java and present a set of working tests.

## Pseudocode Review
This pseudocode outlines two functions: Insert and InsertionSort. The Insert function is responsible for inserting a value into the sorted part of the array. The InsertionSort function creates a new sorted array and inserts elements from the input array into it.

## visualization Insertion Sort 
walk through the algorithm with a sample input array: [8, 4, 23, 42, 16, 15]. We will create a table to represent the sorted array after each iteration of the InsertionSort function.

Iteration	Sorted Array
1	         [8]
2	         [4, 8]
3	         [4, 8, 23]
4	         [4, 8, 23, 42]
5	         [4, 8, 16, 23, 42]
6	         [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
The sorted array is built by inserting each element from the input array into its correct position.

## Complexity 
The time complexity of the Insertion Sort algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst-case and average-case scenarios, and O(n) in the best-case scenario.


## Summary
In this blog article, I've covered the Insertion Sort algorithm, visualized its step-by-step operation, and provided a Java implementation with comprehensive tests. Insertion Sort is a fundamental sorting algorithm that is often used in practice for small datasets and as part of more complex sorting algorithms like Timsort.
